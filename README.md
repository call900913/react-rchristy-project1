# MyReads: A Book Tracking App

This project creates a React web app where you can put books in three different shelves/categories: have read, currently reading, or want to read. The app has a search page with a feature that searches a list of books which comes from an API.

The project initializes with Facebook's create-react-app scaffolding and some HTML+CSS code from @richardkalehoff of Udacity.

I'm responsible for all the functionality of the app and the React code behind that functionality.


## Dependencies
The primary dependency of the project is NodeJS: you need to have Node JS installed on your machine if you intend to try to open this app locally.
You can check whether you have Node installed by typing `node --version` from your Command Line.
The rest of the dependencies will be taken care of by `npm i` found in the next section.
Please visit [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you don't currently have Node installed.

## Launching the app

1. You can start by cloning the file:
a. Navigate to the GitHub repo page: [https://github.com/call900913/reactUI-rchristy-project1](https://github.com/call900913/reactUI-rchristy-project1).
b. Click on the green `Clone or download` button and then click on the `Download ZIP` button, or you can type this line from your Command Line:
```
git clone https://github.com/call900913/reactUI-rchristy-project1.git
```

2. Navigate to the project root directory and type in the following command:
```
npm install
```

3. Next, run this command to start the local server and launch the app:
```
npm start
```

The app and its files have been designed to highlight a structure of Components, a hallmark feature of React.
