# MyReads: A Book Tracking App

This project creates a React web app where you can put books in three different shelves/categories: have read, currently reading, or want to read.

The project initializes with Facebook's create-react-app scaffolding and some HTML+CSS code from @richardkalehoff of Udacity.

I'm responsible for all the functionality of the app and the React code behind that functionality.
